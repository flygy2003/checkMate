## Intoduction
A flgiht companion for the modern pilot, CheckMate is the next great stride in securing everyone from small GA flyers to large long-haulers.
## Identifying The Problem
Even before pilots attain their private pilot liscences, they are required to complete several hours of solo flight.
Experienced pilots all agree that having a buddy come along can brighten up the trip.
Aside from having someone to talk to at cruise-altitude, a companion pilot can drastically increase pilot safety before the aircraft takes-off.
Properly performing the items listed on pre-flight and related checklists is crucial to identifying hazards ensuring a safe flight.
A co-pilot can make sure that the pilot-in-command (PIC) does not miss any items by solely keeping track of the checklist while the PIC performs the checks.
In otherwords, solo-pilots are exposed to great risk even before they take off since it is easy to misread or skip items of the checklist(s).
## Solution Statement
We hope to give every pilot a buddy to bring along, except one that fits in the palm of the hand.
With CheckMate, no pilot goes alone, no checklist unread, no check unchecked.
By using voice-recognition and Pilot-Audio-System (PAS) output streams, CheckMate both reads and awaits the tasks to be completed, and the contents of each lsit are fully customizeable.
#Happy Flying!
